   abstract = {This paper is intended to pave the way for new researchers in the field of robotics and autonomous systems, particularly thosewho are interested in robot localization and mapping. We discuss the fundamentals of robot navigation requirements and provide a reviewof the state of the art tech- niques that form the bases of established solutions formobile robots localization and mapping. The topicswediscuss range from basic localization techniques such as wheel odometry and dead reckoning, to the more advance Visual Odometry (VO) and Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) techniques. We discuss VO in both monocular and stereo vision systems using feature matching/tracking and optical flow techniques.We discuss and compare the basics of most common SLAM methods such as the Extended Kalman Fil- ter SLAM (EKF-SLAM), Particle Filter and the most recent RGB-D SLAM. We also provide techniques that form the building blocks to those methods such as feature extraction (i.e. SIFT, SURF, FAST), feature matching, outlier removal and data association techniques.},

   abstract = {The representation of the physical world is an issue that concerns the scientific community studying computer vision, more and more. Recently, research has focused on modern techniques and methods of photogrammetry and stereoscopy with the aim of reconstructing three-dimensional realistic models with high accuracy and metric information in a short time. In order to obtain data at a relatively low cost, various tools have been developed, such as depth cameras. RGB-D cameras are novel sensing systems that capture RGB images along with per-pixel depth information. This survey aims to describe RGB-D camera technology. We discuss the hardware and data acquisition process, in both static and dynamic environments. Depth map sensing techniques are described, focusing on their features, pros, cons, and limitations; emerging challenges and open issues to investigate are analyzed; and some countermeasures are described. In addition, the advantages, disadvantages, and limitations of RGB-D cameras in all aspects are also described critically. This survey will be useful for researchers who want to acquire, process, and analyze the data collected.},
