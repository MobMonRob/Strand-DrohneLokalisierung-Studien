We discuss the fundamentals of robot navigation requirements and provide a reviewof the state of the art tech- niques that form the bases of established solutions formobile robots localization and mapping. The topicswediscuss range from basic localization techniques such as wheel odometry and dead reckoning, to the more advance Visual Odometry (VO) and Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) techniques. We discuss VO in both monocular and stereo vision systems using feature matching/tracking and optical flow techniques.We discuss and compare the basics of most common SLAM methods such as the Extended Kalman Fil- ter SLAM (EKF-SLAM), Particle Filter and the most recent RGB-D SLAM. We also provide techniques that form the building blocks to those methods such as feature extraction (i.e. SIFT, SURF, FAST), feature matching, outlier removal and data association techniques.},

ABSTRACT = {The representation of the physical world is an issue that concerns the scientific community studying computer vision, more and more. Recently, research has focused on modern techniques and methods of photogrammetry and stereoscopy with the aim of reconstructing three-dimensional realistic models with high accuracy and metric information in a short time. In order to obtain data at a relatively low cost, various tools have been developed, such as depth cameras. RGB-D cameras are novel sensing systems that capture RGB images along with per-pixel depth information. This survey aims to describe RGB-D camera technology. We discuss the hardware and data acquisition process, in both static and dynamic environments. Depth map sensing techniques are described, focusing on their features, pros, cons, and limitations; emerging challenges and open issues to investigate are analyzed; and some countermeasures are described. In addition, the advantages, disadvantages, and limitations of RGB-D cameras in all aspects are also described critically. This survey will be useful for researchers who want to acquire, process, and analyze the data collected.},

note = {; This book is the first textbook specially on multicopter systems in the world. It provides a comprehensive overview of multicopter systems, rather than focusing on a single method or technique. The fifteen chapters are divided into five parts, covering the topics of multicopter design, modeling, state estimation, control, and decision-making. It differs from other books in the field in three major respects: it is basic and practical, offering self-contained content and presenting hands-on methods; it is comprehensive and systematic; and it is timely. It is also closely related to the autopilot that users often employ today and provides insights into the code employed. As such, it offers a valuable resource for anyone interested in multicopters, including students, teachers, researchers, and engineers. Introduction -- PART I DESIGN -- Basic Composition -- Configuration and Structural Design -- Modeling and evaluation of propulsion system -- PART II MODELING -- Coordinate system and attitude representation -- Dynamic model and parameter identification -- PART III ESTIMATION -- Sensor model and calibration -- Observability and Kalman filter -- State estimation -- PART IV CONTROL -- Stability and Controllability -- Low-Level Flight Control -- Position Control based on SemiAutonomous Autopilot -- PART V DECISION -- Mission Decision-Making -- Health Evaluation and Failsafe -- Outlook},

This book focuses on the fundamentals and recent advances in RGB-D imaging as well as covering a range of RGB-D applications. The topics covered include: data acquisition, data quality assessment, filling holes, 3D reconstruction, SLAM, multiple depth camera systems, segmentation, object detection, salience detection, pose estimation, geometric modelling, fall detection, autonomous driving, motor rehabilitation therapy, people counting and cognitive service robots. The availability of cheap RGB-D sensors has led to an explosion over the last five years in the capture and application of colour plus depth data. The addition of depth data to regular RGB images vastly increases the range of applications, and has resulted in a demand for robust and real-time processing of RGB-D data. There remain many technical challenges, and RGB-D image processing is an ongoing research area. This book covers the full state of the art, and consists of a series of chapters by internationally renowned experts in the field. Each chapter is written so as to provide a detailed overview of that topic. RGB-D Image Analysis and Processing will enable both students and professional developers alike to quickly get up to speed with contemporary techniques, and apply RGB-D imaging in their own projects},
